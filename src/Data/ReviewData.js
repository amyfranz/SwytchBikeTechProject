      "I started using my ‘Swytched‘ bike and it has been fantastic. Hitting those hills is much easier. I had some hiccups when converting my bike but Swytch technical team helped me every step of the way.",

      "Would definitely recommend to anyone wanting to save money, I was looking at some Bosch eBikes in Bristol which were very expensive. I think this kit isn‘t quite as high quality but it is good quality, and most importantly though very easy to use. Also it arrived early which I wasn‘t expecting!",

      "My kit arrived 2 months early, very pleased as was expecting it in March. Fitted super quickly to my Brompton B75 and I had a great first commute to work today in central London with it. Lovely stuff thanks Swytch!",

    review:
      "After a few minor challenges over fitting( which were resolved speedily by support) the kit has performed flawlessly so far and I‘m impressed with the power it has. The biggest negative has been the size and weight of the battery, but that seems to have been resolved with the new generation of light weight batteries. The biggest plus has been the fact that I didn‘t have to buy a new bike - I could use my trusty Trek!",
